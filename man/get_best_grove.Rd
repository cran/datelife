\title{Get grove from a \code{datelifeResult} object that can be converted to phylo
from a median summary matrix}
\usage{
get_best_grove(datelife_result, criterion = "taxa", n = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{datelife_result}{A \code{datelifeResult} object. Only needed for \code{criterion = "taxa"}.}

\item{criterion}{Defaults to \code{criterion = "taxa"}. Used for chronogram summarizing, i.e., obtaining a single
summary chronogram from a group of input chronograms.
For summarizing approaches that return a single summary tree from a group of
phylogenetic trees, it is necessary that the latter form a grove, roughly,
a sufficiently overlapping set of taxa between trees, see An√© et al. (2009) \doi{10.1007/s00026-009-0017-x}.
In rare cases, a group of trees can have multiple groves. This argument indicates
whether to get the grove with the most trees (\code{criterion = "trees"}) or the
most taxa (\code{criterion = "taxa"}).}

\item{n}{The degree of taxon name overlap among input chronograms. Defaults
to \code{n = 2}, i.e., at least two overlapping taxon names.}
}
\value{
A list of two elements:
\describe{
\item{best_grove}{A \code{datelifeResult} object filtered to only include one grove of trees that can be summarized with median or sdm.
}
\item{overlap}{The degree of taxon names overlap among trees in the best grove.
}
